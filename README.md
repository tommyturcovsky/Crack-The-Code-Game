## How To Play

The Hacker (the player) is trying to break into a top secret computer. The correct passcode will gain access to it. The Hacker only has only 4 guesses before they are locked out of the terminal and lose. On each incorrect guess, the computer will indicate how many letter positions are correct.

For example, if the password is DANCE and the player guesses DENSE, the game will indicate that 4 out of 5 positions are correct (D_NCE). Likewise, if the password is HOPEFUL and the player guesses PANTING, the game will report 0/7 because while some of the letters match, they're in the wrong position.

Happy Hacking!
